Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf)
 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with,
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 This packages installs the following avahi utility programs:
 avahi-browse, avahi-publish, avahi-resolve, avahi-set-host-name.
 It also automatically adds the required libavahi-client package.
 For more information please see the avahi documentation.
